This is a simple real time emotion detection model along with voice tone analysis.

The working model for voice tone analysis is saved as mlp_model.pkl file.

The working model for real time detection is saved as model_weights.h5 file.

The gui file is saved as speech.py.

This is the link for demonstration video of working model--
